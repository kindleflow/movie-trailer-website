The python program can be compiled by running 
    "python entertainment_center.py"
in the terminal.  

Besides, it needs visits to  
    http://www.omdbapi.com/
    https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search
to fetch IMDB image url, youtube video url and other meta data.  

In the end, the program will generate and open an HTML file called 
    "fresh_tomatoes.html"
in the same directory.  



Movie titles are stored in data.py.  One can edit them to let the 
program generate the webpage for his desired movies.
